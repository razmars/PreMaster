# PreMaster Project
Time series forecasting plays a critical role in various domains such as finance, economics, meteorology, and engineering, among others. It involves predicting future values based on historical data points collected at regular intervals over time. Traditional statistical methods have long been employed for time series forecasting, but with the arrival of deep learning techniques such as Transformers, there has been a significant shift towards more advanced and accurate forecasting models. In this project you will be exposed to a prominent deep learning architecture and will be handed several tasks. The main purpose of this project is to introduce the student to the different research frontiers of interest to the lab and bring the studentâ€™s technical skills up to speed with the rest of the lab members.
